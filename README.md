# Chaos Messages

## Introduction
This repository is for my final project in Math 181: Dynamical Systems. The code is based off of the work done in [1] which is about a circuit-based implementation of encryption using the Lorenz system. Rather than a circuit, the paper's implementation was done numerically using primarily `DifferentialEquations.jl`. 

See final report [here](/project_paper/projectPaper.pdf).
